                    # Similar-Movie-Finder
This application allows the user to search up a movie by it's title 
and the app will pull from the MovieDB database to display poster 
images of movies with that title. The api infomation is converted
with Moshi, and then displayed to theUI using RecyclerView. The MovieDB 
database is a collection of user ratings, movie infomation, ect and 
contains much more infomation than is being used in this project. 
For future iterations I plan on allowing the user to click on movies
to then be brought to a page with more details, and a list
of similar movies to the one selected
